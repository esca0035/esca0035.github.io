    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p> Hello! I am <strong>Eimy Escaba</strong>, I am 19 years old, and I'm from Mexico City. I am currently living in Canada because I am studying interactive media design at Algonquin College; ever since I graduated high school, I have dreamed of studying abroad. Unfortunately, it was hard to convince my parents because it was costly, but I decided to keep trying and reach my goals, and I am here now! </p>
       
    <abbr title="Music"></abbr>
    <p>  I love music, music has always been significant in my life. Actually, when I was little, I used to sing a lot! I even auditioned for <em>the voice kids</em> in Mexico, I didn't get in, but it was fun to try! I am always listening to music; it is something I enjoy doing. Bad Bunny is one of my favorite singers. Also, Ariana Grande and Alec Benjamin, I would love to attend one of their concerts! </p>
